		<h3 id="disclaimer"><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Although support is not required of ThemeForest authors, I do offer support for the theme and its core features and functionality. I cannot guarantee that this theme will function with all third-party components and plugins. Zox News Theme is presented as is.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="installation"><strong>Installation/Homepage Setup</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Make sure that you have the latest version of Wordpress installed.</li>
			<li>You can upload Zox News to Wordpress in one of two different ways:
				<ul>
					<li>Extract the <strong>zox-news.zip</strong> and upload the extracted <strong>zox-news</strong> folder to the <strong>/wp-content/themes/</strong> directory on your FTP server.</li>
					<li><strong>OR</strong> go to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong> and click on the <strong>Add New</strong> link at the top. Then click <strong>Upload Theme</strong> and click <strong>Choose File</strong>, then select <strong>zox-news.zip</strong> and click <strong>Install Now</strong>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>After you upload the theme, activate it by going to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong> and place your mouse over <strong>Zox News</strong> and click the <strong>Activate</strong> button underneath.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>After installing the theme, you can do one of two things: 1) Import the demo data, or 2) follow the instructions to set up the theme with the existing posts/data you have on your site.</p>

		<h4><strong>Importing the Demo Data</strong></h4>

		<ol>
			<li>When you activate the theme, you will see a notification at the top of your WordPress Dashboard prompting you to install plugins that are included with the theme. Click the <strong>Begin installing plugins</strong> link within the notification.</li>
			<li>Click the check box next to the <strong>MVP Themes Social Buttons</strong> and <strong>One Click Demo Import</strong> plugins, as well as any of the other plugins you plan to use, then within the <strong>Bulk Actions</strong> dropdown menu, select <strong>Install</strong>, then click the <strong>Apply</strong> button. Your plugins should now be installed and activated.
			<li>Go to <strong>Appearance > Import Demo Data</strong> and click the <strong>Import Demo Data</strong> button.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>NOTE: The XML data does not come with the images from the demo, which are not licensed to be included in the theme file.</p>

		<h4><strong>Setting up the theme with your existing posts/data</strong></h4>

		<ol>
			<li>When you activate the theme, you will see a notification at the top of your WordPress Dashboard prompting you to install plugins that are included with the theme. Click the <strong>Begin installing plugins</strong> link within the notification.</li>
			<li>Click the check box next to the <strong>MVP Themes Social Buttons</strong> as well as any of the other plugins you plan to use, then within the <strong>Bulk Actions</strong> dropdown menu, select <strong>Install</strong>, then click the <strong>Apply</strong> button. Your plugins should now be installed and activated.
			<li>Go to <strong>Pages > Add New</strong>. Enter <strong>Home</strong> as the title and in the <strong>Page Attributes</strong> section, select <strong>Home</strong> from the <strong>Templates</strong> dropdown menu on the right. Click <strong>Publish</strong>.</li>
			<li>Go to <strong>Settings > Reading</strong> and select the <strong>A static page</strong> radio button and in the <strong>Front Page:</strong> dropdown menu, select <strong>Home</strong>. Click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</li>
			<li>To set up the <strong>Featured Posts</strong> section of your homepage, go to <strong>Zox News Options > Homepage Settings</strong> and select a <strong>Featured Posts Layout</strong>, and assign a <strong>Featured Posts Tag Slug</strong> that is associated with the <strong>Tag</strong> you want to use for your <strong>Featured Posts</strong>. Posts with this Tag will be displayed in the <strong>Featured Posts</strong> at the top of the homepage. You can find the slug for the Tag you want to use by going to <strong>Posts > Tags</strong> and then find the Tag you want to use for the Featured Posts section and find the slug for that Tag in the <strong>Slug</strong> column. To find more information on how to find the Tag Slug, click <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/slugs/">here</a>.
			<li>To set up the <strong>Widgets</strong> on your homepage, you can go to <strong>Appearance > Widgets</strong> and add any widgets to the <strong>Homepage Widget Area</strong>. You can view the widget layout from the demo in the <a href="#widgets">Widgets</a> section of this documentation as well as more information about how to utilize the other widgetized areas.</li>
			<li>To set up your menus, please refer to the <a href="#menus">Custom Menus</a> section of this documentation.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>In order to utilize the various social media links & sharing buttons throughout the site, you will need to install the <strong>MVP Social Buttons</strong> plugin that comes with the theme. You can find the plugin (<strong>mvp-social-buttons.zip</strong>) in the /plugins folder of your original zip file you downloaded from Themeforest.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="update"><strong>Updating the Theme</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>From time to time, a theme update will be released that either fixes a bug and/or adds new features to the theme. It is recommended that you install the <a href="https://envato.github.io/wp-envato-market/" target="_blank">Envato Market Plugin</a> so you can easily install theme updates directly from your WordPress Dashboard with one click. However, there are two other ways you can update the theme:

		<ol>
			<li>Remove the old version of the theme by going to <strong>Appearance > Themes</strong> and activating another theme (you may want to place your site in Maintenance mode via a plugin). Then, hover your mouse over the Zox News theme image and click <strong>Theme Details</strong>. Then click <strong>delete</strong> in the lower right corner of the window that appears. Then, follow the installation instructions above to install the new version of the theme.</li>
			<li><strong>OR</strong> you can upload the new <strong>/zox-news</strong> folder (located in the <strong>zox-news.zip</strong> file) via FTP and overwrite the old files.</li>
		</ol>

		<p><strong style="color: #ef0000;">NOTE: Updating the theme will overwrite any changes you made to any of the core files (index.php, style.css, header.php, etc), however, you will not lose any changes you made to the Theme Options, menus, widgets, etc.</strong></p>

		<p><strong style="color: #ef0000;">Also, make sure to go to your Theme Options and click "Save all changes" after each time you update the theme to make sure any new options are generated properly.</strong></p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="themeoptions"><strong>Theme Options</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Zox News comes with custom Theme Options to allow you to set up many of the theme features without touching the code. To edit the Theme Options, go to <strong>Appearance > Zox News Options</strong>.</p>
